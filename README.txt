Data structure: An 2-d integer array is used to store the board. A self-defined data structure “Chess” is used to store the movement of each piece. It contains two integer arrays x and y that stores the move directions, x = -1 means up,  x = 1 means down, y = -1 means left, y = 1 means right. Two integer type variable “steps” and “directions” which stores how many steps can a piece move at each direction and how many directions can a piece move. 
Algorithm: After read in a board, loop through each piece in the board, first determine which side it belongs to (white or black), and then try to place it in all possible places it is able to reach by looping though directions and steps under its corresponding “chess” data structure. At the same time, keep checking if this pieces reaches the edge of any other pieces. The message (whether white or black side wins) will be displayed when the piece reaches the other side King for the same thing in one direction of movement. If either side of King is not reached, the drawl message will be displayed after every piece is checked.
