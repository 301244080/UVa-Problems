# GATTACA(11512)

## Data structure:     

    SuffixArray

## Algorithm:    

    1. Parsing each input data as Suffix Array

    2. By the rule of Suffix Array, compare each element's prifix and find the longest common prefix by compare neighbors element

    3. For the longest common prefix method, it will return the longest repeat substring 
    
    4. Check the repeat element length, if it's longer than old one, update it as new result 

    5. Return the result and repeat times.
