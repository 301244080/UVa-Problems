Each node can only be visited once, each edge can only be visited once.
This question is to give you at most 21 maps which contains the correlation between streets. You are asked to list all possible routes from firestation to the fire.
Data Structure:
map[] contains all correlation between stations
visit[] array is used to mark all visited nodes
save[] array contains all save routes

Algorithm: We apply a DFS on map[] to find all possible routes, at the same time visit[] array is used to mark visited routes in order to trim unwanted branches for DFS (in case the time is exceeded)
